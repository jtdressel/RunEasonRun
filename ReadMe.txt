Structure:

The program has 2 modes: starting mode and playing
mode. The program first runs starting mode until 
the user hit the keyboard (exit when ESC is hit).
Then the program switches to playing mode. for each
mode, the program will run in an infinite loop and
first checks the input events and change the status
of each corresponding object; and then update all 
the objects, such as images, coordinates 
and other attributes; and then draw all the objects
onto the screen.

Run Main.py to execute the program.

Controls:

Space: jump. Allows double jump when Eason is in the air

K: drop onto the floors fast

A: Eason rushes to the front and attacks the enimies
